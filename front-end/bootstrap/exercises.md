# Pure Bootstrap Grid
You'll have to recreate this page: http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/01-Pure-Bootstrap-grid/
Read the entire exercise in kitt before you get started cause this one is really well explained and they give you all the steps you need to bring this to a good end. Discuss the steps and how you're going to solve it with your buddy!

#Advanced Bootstrap Grid
For this exercise Kitt explains two techniques how you can add padding, border, margin to a grid and still make it work. Read the techniques and make sure you understand it. When you understand the concepts, you're going to have to recreate this page: http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/02-Advanced-Bootstrap-grid/

#Bootstrap mockup v1
Once again, we're going to recreate a page: http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/02-Advanced-Bootstrap-grid/ You'll see the need for bootstrap and we'll be very happy it's out there! In kitt they give you the code you can't write yourself yet (since it's stuff we're going to cover later), so read the entire exercise first, then think about all the parts the page exists. Also look at the boilerplate and the files that are already in the challenge. Before you start styling things, make sure you have all your content in your index page and then start styling it.

#Bootstrap mockup v2
This is actually an improvement on the previous exercise and you'll have to make it look like this: http://lewagon.github.io/bootstrap-challenges/04-bootstrap-mockup-v2/
Create your grid first without any content
