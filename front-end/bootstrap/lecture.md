# Introduction
http://getbootstrap.com/
What is bootstrap? It is a HTML, CSS and JS framework and it made my life a lot easier. You'll use it a lot during your project and you'll be happy that it exists. We use it because often we have to use the same css when I create a new project:
  - center the main div
  - buttons / navigation system ..
  - grid ("mobile first") / full responsive

Sidenote: it was created by our friends at Twitter as an internal framework, but in 2011 it was released as an open source project!

OPEN: boilerplate; tell them it's availble at: https://github.com/lewagon/bootstrap-boilerplate

The bootstrap website has a good documentation, so everything that is not covered in this lesson, you can find it at that website: http://getbootstrap.com/css/

If you want to get inspired with some websites: http://builtwithbootstrap.com/

# Basic CSS
So the good thing about using bootstrap is that it has a lot of pre-defined classes for you, so as soon as you include the bootstrap css, you can start using them! For text-alignment, lists, images, buttons, ..

We'll go over a few examples, but once again, take a look at the documentations and examples at the bootstrap website and try out some things yourself! It is the best way to learn!

CREATE: text-alignment.html
CREATE: list-inline.html
CREATE: buttons.html
CREATE: forms.html (remove the form-inline to show the difference)

# Components in bootstrap
Bootstrap has tons of reusable components like icons, dropdowns, input groups, navigation, alerts..
Don't reinvent the wheel! Use it when you can! Again, you can find more documentation and examples on http://getbootstrap.com/components/

CREATE: components.html
CREATE: navigation.html
CREATE: alerts.html

# Modals!
I like modals!
