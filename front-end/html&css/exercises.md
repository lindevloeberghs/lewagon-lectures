# Before the exercises
Install the needed gems and other things like in the slides

# Profile Content
We're going to create a really simple profile page
An example can be seen here: http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/01-profile-content/
So you're going to rebuild this for yourself.
Follow the steps that are in kitt:
  - make sure you have your media files
  - add the basic skeleton
  - add the pieces of information step by step

# Fonts and colors
You're going to play around with basic css. The files are already created for you.
All you have to do is add css lines to the correct file.
You can see an example here http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/02-fonts-colors/

# Box Model
This is the next step to make our profile page look nice. In the end it should look something like this
http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/03-box-model/
You'll be able to get there by using the box-model we discussed in the lecture

# Advanced selectors
By using classes and ids and styling them, we're going to improve our profile page even more, so that it looks like this http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/04-advanced-selectors/

# Fixed Sidebar
Now we're going to add a sidebar that functions as a menu to the profile page, take a look here http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/05-fixed-sidebar/

You're going to have to use internal links for this!

# Profile Dashboard
We're going to change the layout of the profile page even more, so it looks more like a dashboard. Take a look here: http://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/06-profile-dashboard/

To finish this in a correct way, you're going to want to read the steps that kitt tells you to do:
- first create your main container
- add the needed divs in that container
- make them float by adding a third div
- add the footer div

# Event form
The last exercise for the day! Yay! For this one we're leaving the profile page for what it is and now we want to create a form. But don't forget to style it in the end!

GOOD LUCK!
