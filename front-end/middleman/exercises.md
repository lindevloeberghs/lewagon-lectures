# Content Migration
For the first exercise you're going to migrate the content you create for the stylus landing page yesterday and move it to a middleman app. Make sure you fork and clone the github middleman boilerplate from le wagon first. In kitt it is explained what steps you need to take to do this succesfully.

At the end, when you have no errors in your source code, you can deploy your middleman project! Feel free to share the link with the others on slack, we can learn from each other this way!

# Style Migration
After we refactored and migrated the content part of our website, now it's time to move and organize the stylesheets too! At the end you can commit and deploy again!

For those who finish this early on in the day there are two more optional exercises!
